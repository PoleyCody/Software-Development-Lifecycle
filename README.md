•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret the user’s needs for the system through the user stories, during the user focus group meeting the customers where asked what you would like to see add to the system. The customers gave the product owner ideas of what they would like to see in the system and made user stories of them. These user stories tell me what they would like to see add to the system and why, while giving me an idea on how they would like it to be added to the system. I then take this information and create the ideas they discussed in the meeting. For example, one of customers wanted the ability to choose what type of vacation they would see on the top five vacations to give the customer what they wanted I add a scroll bar with different types of vacation. When the user chooses a type the top five destinations change to these types of vacations.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by first reading the clients wants for the system making notes and writing questions to ask the client if need. I then start with the design of the system, how should it work, does it need a database, does it need to be encrypted, what class with what methods are needed, and finally what should the user interface look like. I then break it down into small parts testing them as I go to ensure they work, and the system meets all requirements. If I was to choose the agile process, I would hope to use in the future I would choose the Scrum process because as a developer I feel the user stories and sprint backlog really help the development process and allow me as a developer succeed by having a Scrum master ensuring the team stays on track through out the development process and give a voice to the client.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development shows up on time, doing their work within a timely manner, is enthusiastic about the product and the work, and is willing to give the product 100%. When it comes to being a good team member doing your best and creating what the client wants is important but being enthusiastic about your work is more important because if you are happy to work on the product and feel fulfilled with creating. Then the process will go faster and the client will see what they want in your product and want it.
